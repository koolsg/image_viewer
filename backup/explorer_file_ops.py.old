"""Compatibility shim for the historic `explorer_file_ops` module.

This module used to contain clipboard/paste/delete helpers for the Explorer UI. The
helpers were moved into `image_viewer.file_operations` as part of a cleanup. To keep
backwards compatibility for imports, this module now re-exports the functions from
`file_operations` and emits a deprecation warning on import.
